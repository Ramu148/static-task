        Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients,
that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread,
but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries,
meringues, custards, and pies. The most commonly used cake ingredients
include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening
agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients
and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts
such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like
pastry cream), iced with butter cream or other icings, and decorated with
marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
